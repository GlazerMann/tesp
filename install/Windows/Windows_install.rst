Installing on Windows
---------------------

Native TESP installers are no longer maintained for Windows. One reason is that
some TESP federates run better on Linux than other platforms, even given the same
hardware. The choices for TESP usage on Windows are:

1. Use the, e.g., *docker pull temcderm/tesp_core:v1*  
2. Follow directions for :ref:`LinuxInstall` inside a virtual machine

To get started after basic installation:

1. (UPDATE NEEDED) Try the video tutorial at https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/releases
2. (UPDATE NEEDED) Try :ref:`RunExamples`
