Installing on Mac OS X
----------------------

Native TESP installers are no longer maintained for Mac OS X. One reason is that
some TESP federates run better on Linux than other platforms, even given the same
hardware. The choices for TESP usage on Mac OS X are:

1. Use the `Docker Version`_  
2. Follow directions for :ref:`LinuxInstall` inside a virtual machine

To get started after basic installation:

1. (UPDATE NEEDED) Try the video tutorial at https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/releases
2. (UPDATE NEEDED) Try :ref:`RunExamples` 

.. _`Docker Version`: https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/blob/develop/install/Docker/ReadMe.md
