~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run and plot the GridLAB-D base case, with no transactive agents:

::

 cd ~/tesp/examples/ieee8500
 python3 glm_dict.py IEEE_8500
 gridlabd IEEE_8500.glm
 python3 process_gld.py IEEE_8500
 python3 process_voltages.py IEEE_8500

To run and plot the PNNL variant with smart inverter functions and
precooling thermostat agents, use the following steps. There are
also two faster 30-house examples in this directory, one of them
with agent-based calculation of the house equivalent thermal parameters.

::

 cd ~/tesp/examples/ieee8500/PNNLteam
 python3 prepare_cases.py
 ./run8500.sh
 python3 plots.py inv8500
 python3 bill.py inv8500
 python3 plot_invs.py inv8500
